Game: Tic-Tac-Toe

The program created is modeling a Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played with a 3 by 3 board,
and with two players. Player 1 will model an X, and player 2 will model an O. The goal
of this game is for the players to obtain a 3 of the kind with their piece. 3 of a kinds
can either be a horizontal win, a vertical win or a diagonal win. The game ends under two
conditions: either if player 1 and player 2 obtain 3 of a kind, or if the board is full with
no winner. Taking that under consideration, if the board is full without a winning move from
either player 1 and player 2, then the game ends in a draw.

Rules:

    * Player 1 and Player 2 will alternate turns
    * When prompted for a position, it must be entered in the following format
        <rowNumber> <columnNumber>
    * The row and column parameters must be greater than than 0 or less than or equal to
3.
        Visual: 0 < row,column < 3

    * 3 of a kinds are obtained by doing either of the following
        Horizontal Wins: P  P  P
        Vertical Wins: P
                       P
                       P
        Diagonal Wins:
            P                     P
              P         OR      P
                P             P

    * If the game ends with 3 of a kind, the player wins!
    * If the game ends without 3 of a kind, the game ends in a draw!
